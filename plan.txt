Server is to be considered compromised at all times


all messages are encrypted at all times

client side data is stored encrypted and can be backed up to icloud and stuff

client app requires login to decrypt the client data

The Username:
    The username is used to connect to other people
    The server stores a hash of the password with a global salt
    The salt should rotate regularly

    maybe use a password hashing algo to make it harder to crack

    Problems:
        Once a username hash is cracked, then it doesn't have perfect forward security
        more simple usernames will be trivial to crack

        usernames need an associated password so they can't be stolen
        this makes rotating the username salt effectively useless, as a compromised server will
        see that the password is the same, and if the password changes, both the new and old password
        would need to be provided, which links the old and new username.


Giving people your username/contact info:

    One person will send a public key


DMs:

    first message sent is the opposite users username (sent automatically), this ensures you are talking to who you are meant to,
    because they wont send the right username if you aren't.

    It doesn't have to be your username.


Problems:
