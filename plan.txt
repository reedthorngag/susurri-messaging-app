
Server is to be considered compromised at all times


all messages are encrypted at all times

Problems:
    Knowing a username makes it possible for anyone to trace every action of that user

    Having a "root" userhash and pubkey makes any first contact where the contacter fetches the pubkey
    and then sends a message then links that current userhash to the root user, partially breaking anonymity

    Getting old unread messages links every hash since the last time online together/to the current hash
    possibly use a background process that regularly connects and fetches messages after each hash change.
    this can potentially be linked if the ip doesnt change though.
    
Solutions/ideas:

    Offer the potential to proxy through tor


Client side data:
    client side data is stored encrypted and can be backed up to icloud and stuff

    client app requires login to decrypt the client data, the data file name is a hash of the users username and password
    And the data is encrypted with AES 256 using the users password

Problems:
        Once a username hash is cracked then it doesn't have perfect forward security

        more simple usernames will be trivial to crack (users will be made aware of this, and users who care can use a stronger username)

The Username:
    The username is used to message people
    The server stores a hash of the username with a global salt
    The salt should rotate regularly

    maybe use a password hashing algo to make it harder to crack


Giving people your username/contact info:

    Over another messaging service:
        One person will send a public key, the other then encrypts their username with it, and sends it back
    
    In person:
        Just give them your username, and make sure they get the spelling right


DMs:

    first message sent is the opposite users username (sent automatically), this ensures you are talking to who you are meant to.
    This doesn't guarantee you are talking to the right person, but it makes it harder for an attacker as this 
    forces them to brute force your username or find it out another way.

    It doesn't have to be your username.
